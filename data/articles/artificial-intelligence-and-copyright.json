            "text": "The rapid evolution of generative AI has ignited a fervent debate surrounding its intersection with intellectual property rights. Last month, I had the privilege of participating in a moot court competition hosted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), where we delved into the complex issue of whether the utilization of generative AI, trained on datasets containing cultural heritage artifacts, to generate NFTs constitutes copyright infringement. This essay serves as an analysis of this critical question, examining the potential infringement of copyright in AI-generated images. By exploring the nuances of this emerging legal landscape, I aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse and offer insights for policymakers, legal professionals, and creators alike.The Nature of AI-Generated Content and Copyright Law"

However, if the AI model generates content autonomously, without significant human intervention, it may be difficult to identify a clear author."
