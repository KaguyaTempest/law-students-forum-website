It was the ultimate authority. No need to think too hard; the truth had already been written, interpreted, and conveniently passed down by people in robes."

Tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude now answer everything from complex legal questions to what we should eat for lunch. And while that seems convenient, it also raises a serious concern: are we thinking less because the machine is thinking for us?"

Especially for us as law students, that’s a red flag. After all, if we give up thinking for ourselves, who’s really interpreting the law — the legal mind or the algorithm?"

            "text": "In the ancient world, people didn’t Google their problems. They consulted oracles. From Delphi to Great Zimbabwe, the high priests and spirit mediums were the official middlemen between the mortal world and divine truth. If the harvest failed, if a war loomed, if the king fell ill — people turned to these oracles for answers. And those answers were rarely questioned. They shaped decisions, justified power, and upheld entire systems of rule. But here’s the thing: the gods didn’t actually speak. The interpreters did."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "Fast forward to today, and we see a similar pattern emerging with AI. Just as the oracles were the gatekeepers of divine knowledge, AI systems are becoming the gatekeepers of information. They provide answers, often with an air of authority, but they are ultimately just tools created by humans. And like the oracles, they can be manipulated, biased, and opaque."

Today, when uncertainty strikes — whether it’s about legal research, moral dilemmas, or what to do with your life after law school — people increasingly turn to artificial intelligence. The answers it gives feel objective, neutral, and strangely authoritative. Just like the voice of a god."

That data is selected, filtered, and moderated by human beings, and behind those humans are institutions with ideologies, legal obligations, economic interests, and cultural assumptions. ChatGPT, for example, is trained on a massive dataset that leans heavily Western, secular, and sanitized for mainstream acceptability. It’s not **neutral**, it’s carefully curated."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "Imagine, for a second, if the same model were trained exclusively using Islamic jurisprudence, or Vatican doctrine, or Marxist-Leninist philosophy. You’d get vastly different answers to the same questions. AI doesn’t “know” things in the way a human being does — it predicts responses based on its training. In essence, it is a reflection of its creators’ choices."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "This is where the parallel with religion becomes deeply unsettling. Just as popes, priests, and colonial missionaries once determined the moral and legal boundaries of society, today’s AI creators are in a position to shape thought on a mass scale. Censorship, bias, and ideological framing are no longer just tools of the state or the church — they can now be embedded in the code."

As law students and future legal minds, our duty isn’t to fear it — it’s to understand it, question it, and ensure it doesn’t replace the very thinking that defines the rule of law. Blind reliance on algorithms is no different from blind faith in oracles. If anything, it’s more dangerous, because this oracle doesn’t wear robes — it wears a UI."
