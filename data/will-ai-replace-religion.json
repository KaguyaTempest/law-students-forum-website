  "content": "In my submission, I'd argue that the assertion whether or not \\\"AI is here to replace religion\\\" is not a completely inaccurate analogy.... At one time you had religion being the pinnacle of all human decision making and thought processes, there was a time when humans could not make a decision about their lives without first seeking clerical advice or some form of spiritual guidance through prayer.... even kings sought religious counsel.... \\n\\nHowever, with the passage of time, human beings bore witness to the atrocities brought forth by religion, how a single powerful entity could use religion as an excuse to unleash tyranny... We had women and children being subjected to oppression, mass genocides on account of one religion having \\\"bogus\\\" views towards how a certain religion does things... manipulation by the clergy and societal leaders was also the norm, as can be witnessed through observing the Cultist deaths in both Kenya and Zimbabwe that have been reported on the news as of late and how religion plays a central role in African politics...\\n\\nHowever, in Europe and the Americas, all that has begun to wane, and it appears some unseen entity has devised a way to fix that, a way around the fact that more and more of their \\\"stock\\\" has begun waking up to the reality of the situation they have always been caught up in... And thus comes in \\\"AI\\\".\\n\\nBefore I continue, I feel the need to stress that I am not a conspiracy theorist, but this is simply an observation I have made by myself, I do not have data to support it, and the only sample used in my case study is myself... \\n\\nWhen it was first introduced, it was a step toward achieving a brighter technological future, a great innovation, but the question stands as to \\\"What exactly does AI do???\\\"...\\n\\nI'll tell you what it does, it's an advanced form of Google, and what it simply does is it reptiles information at an even faster rate. It's basically Google on steroids... \\n\\nHowever, unlike Google, it appears the world is slowly being groomed into being dependant on this \\\"new\\\" technology. You want an answer to a 3am thought, just ask AI, You want recipes for that dish you've been planning for months, just ask AI, you want help with kids homework, ask AI again, you want points for that argument you're engaged in with your friends? Ask AI... and you want to change an entire person's perception of reality, use AI to convince him that \\\"since the answer has been AI generated, then it must be true\\\".... This dependence is borderline disgusting, and by now I'm sure you know where it's going...\\n\\nThe more we depend on AI, the more we lose our ability to think for ourselves, and the more we lose our ability to think for ourselves, the more we become slaves to the system...\\n\\nAnd this is where I draw the line, because I am not a slave to anything or anyone, and I refuse to be a slave to AI. I will not let it dictate my thoughts or my actions. I will not let it replace my ability to reason and make decisions. I will not let it take away my humanity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while AI may have its benefits, we must be cautious about how we use it and how much we rely on it. We must remember that we are human beings with the ability to think and reason for ourselves. We must not let technology replace our humanity.",
