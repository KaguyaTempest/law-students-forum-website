        <h3>🚧 Campus Strike Update</h3>
        <p>Lecturers at the University of Zimbabwe have been on a full-scale strike since the beginning of the third block. This strike involves total disengagement from teaching, marking, invigilating, and any other duties normally performed by faculty members. Only administrative staff remain on duty.</p>
        <p>The strike is driven by demands for a substantial salary increase. Lecturers, who now earn as little as USD $250 per month due to government wage reductions and years of inflation-driven salary erosion, are demanding a restoration to at least USD $2000. Many recall earning significantly more before the current civil servant wage policy came into effect.</p>
        <p>The effects of the strike have been far-reaching: Block 3 exams were canceled entirely, and the second semester has been forcefully extended from its original closing date of June 15th to the end of the month. The ongoing situation has left students in limbo, juggling academic uncertainty and mental exhaustion.</p>

        <p>Despite the strike, the university has announced that exams will go ahead at the end of June.</p>
