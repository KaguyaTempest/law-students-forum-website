        <h2>Academic & Faculty Update</h2>
        <p class="muted small">Important changes from the Faculty of Law — please read carefully.</p>

        <h3>Curriculum & Teaching Regulations</h3>
        <p>The Faculty of Law has introduced new regulations following stakeholder concerns raised by the Law Society, the National Prosecuting Agency, and the Judicial Service Commission regarding graduate preparedness. Key changes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modules will now be taught on a <strong>semester basis</strong> (rather than monthly block modules).</li>
            <li>Each module will be assigned <strong>two lecturers</strong> to broaden exposure and supervision.</li>
            <li>The curriculum has been expanded with <strong>additional modules</strong> designed to strengthen practical and procedural competence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Professional Track — BLP Intake</h3>
        <p>Students accepted into the <strong>BLP (Practical/Procedural) programme</strong> have been inaugurated and welcomed into the faculty this term. Congratulations to all new BLP students and to Part One students who also had their inauguration ceremonies.</p>

        <h3>Registration & Exam Portal Issues</h3>
        <p class="muted">Some students have reported issues confirming course registrations despite having sat the first block exams. Several modules are not yet visible on the exam portal which has delayed formal registration confirmation. The Faculty is aware and working on fixes; students are advised to keep screenshots and correspondence in case they need to follow up with administration.</p>

        <h2>Student Experience</h2>
        <h3>Part Three Timetable — A heavy load</h3>
        <p>Part Three students have reported particularly packed timetables this block. Typical days have included lectures from <strong>08:00 — 17:00</strong> with short breaks between modules (e.g., 08:00–10:00, 10:00–12:00, 12:00–13:00, 13:00–15:00, 15:00–17:00). We recognise this is overwhelming — please prioritise health and study breaks. If you’re struggling, contact your faculty rep or the Law Society’s welfare desk for support.</p>

        <h3>Exam Block Wrap</h3>
        <p>The first block examinations for the semester concluded this month. Well done to everyone who sat their papers — rest, recover, and review feedback once marks are released. Study groups and revision clinics remain available through LSIF channels.</p>

        <h2>Moots & Competitions</h2>
        <div class="two-col">
            <div>
                <h3>Big Wins — IHL & ZLHR</h3>
                <p>We are proud to announce two recent successes for the Faculty of Law’s mooting teams:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IHL Moots (Harare High Court)</strong> — Our team were champions at the IHL competition held at the Harare High Court. Congratulations to the entire squad and coaching staff.</li>
                    <li><strong>ZLHR Non-Discrimination Moot</strong> — The University of Zimbabwe team of <strong>Miriam Moyo</strong>, <strong>Panashe</strong>, and <strong>Miss R.N. Moyo</strong> were selected from IHL internal scores and secured <strong>third place</strong>, bringing home a monetary prize.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Coaches & The Buddy System</h3>
                <p>The team’s preparation was supported through LSIF’s buddy-system and coaching roster. Special thanks to supervisors who assisted with memorials, research and oral training. The mentorship approach is being expanded to ensure future teams are better supported in both written and oral advocacy.</p>
