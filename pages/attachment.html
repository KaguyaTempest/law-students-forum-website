            <h2>Understanding Legal Attachment</h2>
            <p>Attachment is an integral part of the Bachelor of Laws program at the University of Zimbabwe. It provides invaluable practical experience, bridging the gap between academic learning and the realities of the legal profession. You will undertake attachment in two phases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Second Year: Unpaid Internship</strong> - This introductory phase allows you to observe and assist in a legal setting, gaining foundational insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Third Year: Paid Internship</strong> - Building upon the first experience, this phase often involves more responsibility and provides financial compensation.</li>
            </ul>
