      <h1>Crafting Persuasive Legal Arguments</h1>
      <p>
        At the heart of the legal profession and advocacy lies <strong>legal writing</strong>.
        Often, before you can present your arguments orally, you must first express
        them in writing. In this sense, your writing skills are just as important—if
        not more so—than your oral communication abilities. The way you organize your
        writing will determine whether a reader can understand and be persuaded by
        your argument.

      <h2>Magaya v&nbsp;Magaya</h2>
      <p><em>Supreme Court of Zimbabwe – Judgment No. S.C. 210/98 – Decided 16 February 1999</em></p>
      <p>
        Upon the death of Shoniwa Magaya in 1994, his daughter Venia Magaya was
        appointed heir to his estate by a magistrate’s court. Shortly afterward, her
        younger half‑brother, Nhaka Magaya, contested her appointment on the grounds
        that under Shona customary law a woman could not be appointed heir where a
        male heir existed. The magistrate later reversed its decision, ruling that
        Nhaka should inherit the estate. Venia appealed to the Supreme Court,
        arguing that the customary law principle was discriminatory on the basis of
        sex and thus unconstitutional under the 1980 Constitution of Zimbabwe.
      </p>

      <!-- ------------------ F – Facts ------------------ -->
      <h2 id="facts">F – Facts</h2>
      <p>
        The "F" in FIRAC stands for <strong>Facts</strong>. This is the starting point of any
        legal analysis. The facts of a case form the factual foundation on which the
        legal issues rest. Not every detail is important: the skill lies in
        identifying which facts are <em>legally relevant</em>—those the court must consider
        to resolve the legal question—and which are irrelevant background details
        that do not affect the legal outcome.
      </p>
      <h3>How to identify relevant facts</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Would the court need this fact to decide the legal issue?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If the answer is yes, it's a relevant fact&hellip;</p>
      <h4>Applying it to <em>Magaya v&nbsp;Magaya</em></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Shoniwa Magaya died in 1994.</li>
        <li>His daughter Venia Magaya was initially appointed heir by a magistrate’s court.</li>
        <li>Her younger half‑brother, Nhaka Magaya, contested the appointment based on Shona customary law.</li>
        <li>The magistrate reversed the decision, awarding heirship to Nhaka.</li>
        <li>Venia appealed, arguing the disqualification based on sex was unconstitutional.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- ------------------ I – Issue ------------------ -->
      <h2 id="issue">I – Issue</h2>
      <p>The "I" in FIRAC stands for <strong>Issue</strong>&hellip;</p>
      <h3>What does it mean for an issue to be &ldquo;legally framed&rdquo;?</h3>
      <p>When we say an issue must be legally framed&hellip;</p>
      <p><strong>Legally framed:</strong> Does disqualifying Venia from inheriting under customary law violate her constitutional right to non‑discrimination on the grounds of sex?</p>

      <!-- ------------------ R – Rule ------------------ -->
      <h2 id="rule">R – Rule</h2>
      <p>The "R" in FIRAC stands for <strong>Rule</strong>&hellip;</p>
      <h3>Teaching Point: Be Specific and Precise</h3>
      <p>When stating the rule&hellip;</p>
      <h4>Example of Good Rule Presentation</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Section 23(1) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe&hellip;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Rules Applied in <em>Magaya v&nbsp;Magaya</em></h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Section 23 of the 1980 Constitution of Zimbabwe</strong>&hellip;</li>
        <li><strong>Shona Customary Law on Inheritance</strong>&hellip;</li>
        <li><strong>Administration of Estates Act [Chapter 6:01]</strong>&hellip;</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- ------------------ A – Application ------------------ -->
      <h2 id="application">A – Application</h2>
      <p>The "A" in FIRAC stands for <strong>Application</strong>&hellip;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“The appellant, being a woman, was not entitled to inherit under customary law. That law, in the light of s 23(3), cannot be held to be unconstitutional.”&nbsp;— <em>per Gubbay&nbsp;CJ</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Your Application = Your Argument</h3>
      <p>This is where you do your persuasive work&hellip;</p>

      <!-- ------------------ C – Conclusion ------------------ -->
      <h2 id="conclusion">C – Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Because section 23(3) allows customary rules to govern inheritance&hellip;</p>
