                        Once upon a time, when people didn't know the answer to life's biggest questions: "Why are we here? What is justice? Should I take that job in Gweru?" they turned to religion. It was the ultimate authority. No need to think too hard; the truth had already been written, interpreted, and conveniently passed down by people in robes.

                        Artificial intelligence has become our new oracle. Tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude now answer everything from complex legal questions to what we should eat for lunch. And while that seems convenient, it also raises a serious concern: are we thinking less because the machine is thinking for us?

                            A recent study by <strong>MIT Media Lab</strong> found that the more people rely on AI, the worse they perform on tasks after using it. In other words, AI might be helping in the moment, but it's also quietly draining our brain batteries. That's what researchers call <strong>cognitive debt</strong>.

                        This article takes a closer look at how AI might be sneaking into the role religion once played‚Äînot just as a source of answers, but as a replacement for critical thinking. Especially for us as law students, that's a red flag. After all, if we give up thinking for ourselves, who's really interpreting the law ‚Äî the legal mind or the algorithm?

                        In the ancient world, people didn't Google their problems. They consulted oracles. From Delphi to Great Zimbabwe, the high priests and spirit mediums were the official middlemen between the mortal world and divine truth. If the harvest failed, if a war loomed, if the king fell ill ‚Äî people turned to these oracles for answers. And those answers were rarely questioned.

                    <p>
                        They shaped decisions, justified power, and upheld entire systems of rule. But here's the thing: <em class="emphasis">the gods didn't actually speak. The interpreters did.</em>

Today, when uncertainty strikes ‚Äî whether it's about legal research, moral dilemmas, or what to do with your life after law school ‚Äî people increasingly turn to artificial intelligence. The answers it gives feel objective, neutral, and strangely authoritative. Just like the voice of a god.

                        Every AI model is trained on data. That data is selected, filtered, and moderated by human beings, and behind those humans are institutions with ideologies, legal obligations, economic interests, and cultural assumptions. ChatGPT, for example, is trained on a massive dataset that leans heavily Western, secular, and sanitized for mainstream acceptability.

                            Imagine, for a second, if the same model were trained exclusively using Islamic jurisprudence, or Vatican doctrine, or Marxist-Leninist philosophy. You'd get vastly different answers to the same questions. AI doesn't "know" things in the way a human being does ‚Äî it predicts responses based on its training.

                        This is where the parallel with religion becomes deeply unsettling. Just as popes, priests, and colonial missionaries once determined the moral and legal boundaries of society, today's AI creators are in a position to shape thought on a mass scale. Censorship, bias, and ideological framing are no longer just tools of the state or the church ‚Äî they can now be embedded in the code.

                        The convenience of AI comes with a hidden price: the gradual erosion of our ability to think independently. When we consistently outsource mental effort to algorithms, we risk developing what psychologists call "learned helplessness" ‚Äî the tendency to give up trying because we've become accustomed to external solutions.

                        The legal profession is already grappling with AI integration. Law firms are using AI for document review, contract analysis, and even case strategy. While these tools can increase efficiency and reduce costs, they also raise critical questions about professional competence and ethical responsibility.
