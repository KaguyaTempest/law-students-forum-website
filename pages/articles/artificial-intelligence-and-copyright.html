                        The rapid evolution of generative AI has ignited a fervent debate surrounding its intersection with intellectual property rights. Last month, I had the privilege of participating in a moot court competition hosted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), where we delved into the complex issue of whether the utilization of generative AI, trained on datasets containing cultural heritage artifacts, to generate NFTs constitutes copyright infringement.

                        This essay serves as an analysis of this critical question, examining the potential infringement of copyright in AI-generated images and the broader implications for creators, consumers, and the legal framework governing intellectual property in the digital age.

                    <p>
                        Copyright law protects original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. To be eligible for copyright protection, a work must exhibit a modicum of creativity and originality. This fundamental principle becomes complex when applied to AI-generated content.
                    </p>

                            <li><strong>Originality Requirement:</strong> Works must originate from the author and possess minimal creativity</li>
                            <li><strong>Fixation Requirement:</strong> Works must be fixed in a tangible medium</li>
                            <li><strong>Authorship Question:</strong> Who qualifies as the "author" of AI-generated content?</li>

                    <p>
                        AI-generated content, while often novel and innovative, may not meet the traditional standards of authorship. The question of creativity becomes particularly complex when algorithms generate content without direct human creative input.

                    <p>
                        A key question in determining copyright ownership of AI-generated content is the extent of human intervention in the creative process. This analysis requires examining the spectrum of human involvement from initial prompting to final output curation.

                    <p>
                        If a human author provides substantial creative input, such as writing detailed prompts or curating training data, they may be considered the author of the work. However, if the AI model generates content autonomously, without significant human intervention, it may be difficult to identify a clear author under current legal frameworks.

                    <p>
                        One of the primary concerns regarding AI-generated content is the potential for copyright infringement during the training process. AI models are often trained on vast datasets that include copyrighted works, raising questions about unauthorized use.

                            This landmark case established principles for analyzing unauthorized use of copyrighted material. The court's analysis of the purpose and character of use, nature of the work, amount used, and market effect provides a framework for understanding AI training scenarios.

                        The fair use doctrine may provide a defense against copyright infringement claims in certain cases involving AI-generated content. However, the application of fair use to AI is complex and highly fact-specific.
