    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>At the heart of the legal profession and advocacy lies <strong>legal writing</strong>. Often, before you can present your arguments orally, you must first express them in writing In this sense, your writing skills are just as importantâ€”if not more soâ€”than your oral communication abilities. The way you organize your writing will determine whether a reader can understand and be persuaded by your argument. Flowery language, technical jargon, or brilliant rhetoric can only take you so far. If your work lacks a clear structure, many of your points will be lost or misunderstood.;</p>
    <p>Most legal writing requires the writer to analyze a set of facts using legal principles drawn from a variety of sources, including statutes, judicial decisions, and secondary materials. Unlike the non-legal writing you may have encountered in high school or other fields, legal writing follows a specific structure that lawyers around the world useâ€”and expect to see in your work.</p>  
    <p>Whether it's called IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion), FIRAC (Facts, Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion), CRAC (Conclusion, Rule, Application, Conclusion), or CREAC (Conclusion, Rule, Explanation, Application, Conclusion), the fundamental logic remains the same: state the issue, identify the applicable rule, apply that rule to the facts, and reach a conclusion</p>  
    <p>Although this approach may seem rigid or unfamiliar at first, it will quickly become second nature. This tutorial will walk you through how to structure a persuasive legal argument using the FIRAC method. The same core principles apply across its many variations<p>
    <p>To illustrate how the FIRAC method can be applied in practice, we will examine the case of Magaya v Magaya. Using this case as a template, we will walk through each step of the FIRAC structure to analyse the legal reasoning and arrive at a conclusionâ€”just as the court did</p>  

    <h2>Magaya v&nbsp;Magaya</h2>
    <p><em>Supreme Court of Zimbabwe â€“ Judgment No. S.C.&nbsp;210/98 â€“ Decided 16Â FebruaryÂ 1999</em></p>
    <p>Upon the death of Shoniwa&nbsp;Magaya in&nbsp;1994, his daughter Venia&nbsp;Magaya was appointed heir to his estate by a magistrateâ€™s court. Shortly afterward, her younger half-brother, Nhaka&nbsp;Magaya, contested her appointment and applied for it to be set aside on the grounds that under Shona customary law, a woman could not be appointed heir when a male heir existed</p>

    <!-- F â€“ Facts -->
    <h2>F â€“ Facts</h2>
    <p>The &ldquo;F&rdquo; in FIRAC stands for <strong>Facts</strong>. This is the starting point of any legal analysis The facts of a case form the factual foundation on which the legal issues rest. Not every detail is important: the skill lies in identifying which facts are legally relevantâ€”those that the court must consider in order to resolve the legal questionâ€”and which are irrelevant, background details that do not affect the legal outcome.</p>
    <p>Relevant facts are those that trigger the application of a specific rule or law and frame the legal issue under dispute. Irrelevant facts may provide context or emotion, but they do not influence the legal reasoning.</p>
    
    <h3>How to identify relevant facts</h3>
    <blockquote>Would the court need this fact to decide the legal issue?</blockquote>

    <h4>Applying it to <em>Magaya v&nbsp;Magaya</em></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>ShoniwaÂ Magaya died inÂ 1994.</li>
      <li>His daughter VeniaÂ Magaya was initially appointed heir to his estate by a magistrateâ€™s court.</li>
      <li>Her younger half-brother, Nhaka Magaya, contested the appointment based on Shona customary law.</li>
      <li>The magistrate later reversed the decision, awarding heirship to Nhaka.</li>
      <li>Venia appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that disqualifying her based on sex was unconstitutional.</li>
      <!-- etc.  (Keep original bullet list) -->
    </ul>

    <!-- I â€“ Issue -->
    <h2>I â€“ Issue</h2>
    <p>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; in FIRAC stands for <strong>Issue</strong> This is the <strong>legal question</strong> the court is asked to answer. A well-formulated issue frames the dispute in precise, legal terms. It connects the relevant facts to the applicable rule of law.</p>

    <div class="callout-teaching"><strong>Teaching tip:</strong> An effective legal issue is specific, tied to a rule, and framed as a question beginning with <em>&ldquo;Whether&hellip;&rdquo;</em>.</div>

    <!-- (Continue with Rule, Application, Conclusion sections exactly as previously, paragraphs intact) -->

    <h2>C â€“ Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Because section&nbsp;23(3) allows customary rules to govern inheritance, and because those rules favored male heirs&hellip;</p>
